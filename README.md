An example add-in for [PostSharp](https://postsharp.net).

You can use the code in this repository as a base on which to build your own add-in for PostSharp.

## Creating an add-in
To create your PostSharp add-in using this template as a base, you can:
1. Change "PostSharp.Community.HelloWorld" in all file and folder names to the name of your add-in.
2. Change the text "PostSharp.Community.HelloWorld" in all text files to your add-in.
3. Replace the `HelloWorldAttribute` in `PostSharp.Community.HelloWorld` with any attributes or classes that you want the user of your add-in to be able to access at IntelliSense time, build time and possibly runtime.
4. Update the class `HelloWorldTask` in `PostSharp.Community.HelloWorld.Weaver` with the code of your add-in.
5. Update any other files, such as the `nuspec` file.
6. Use `nuget pack PostSharp.Community.HelloWorld.nuspec` to create a NuGet package from your add-in.
7. To use the add-in, the user just needs to add and install that NuGet package.

## Documentation of the HelloWorld add-in
This add-in adds the line `Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!")` at the beginning of each target method in your code.
 
#### Example
Your code:
```csharp
[HelloWorld]
static int ReturnTheAnswer()
